# Microblog

A small, simple social medium that allows users to make posts, comment, and follow others. Basically a starter template for a social media website.

Microblog is not intended to be a serious webapp or project. Instead, it's meant to be a basic starter project that was intended for me to learn about making webapps.

## How can I run Microblog locally?

Download it as .zip or clone it via git, then run main.py. It should auto-generate empty .db files.

### Dependencies

```
bcrypt
Flask
sqlite3
```
